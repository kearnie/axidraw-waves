I decided to work from the template of order to disorder, already conjuring ideas of singular, streamlined designs that somehow branch 
out or disperse into randomness and chaos–from then it was a methodical process of polishing the visuals: I would hardcode the 
“organized” half of my piece to make sure relevant segments or shapes are precisely and consciously positioned with a purpose, and 
then gradually lose control on the “disorganized” half with randomly generated float variables.

I created several nature-based themes to represent this idea of orderly lines becoming jagged; there were multiple ways of approach: 
flat landscapes to jagged mountains, calm waters to dangerous waves, silence to noise, stalk to branches and swirling vines–all 
of which I sketched and considered.

In conjunction with my past inspirations and works, I settled with the seascape version, and I customized accordingly with the
necessary pens of differing stroke sizes and azure colors to give the flat design a subtle sense of depth. I originally planned 
for the water design to be on a paper that was naturally a light to dark blue gradient color, and to position the waves near the 
boundaries of two opposing shades, but I was unable to obtain such a colored paper and settled on a gray-light blue which I felt 
was neutral. From then, I used the axidraw at paused intervals where I switched out pens to accommodate each particular wave–and 
then I actually shifted and re-ran my program twice to give the visual impression of more lines and depth to the overall product, 
and to retrace some of the lighter, thinner wavelengths to make them darker.

If time and my own mental capabilities when it comes to coding allowed, I would strive to expand this series to encompass my other 
nature ideas as well (landscape, vines, trees, noise), each with its own considered color palette and background texture.
